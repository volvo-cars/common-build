The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - assert-plus@1.0.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# assert-plus

This library is a super small wrapper over node's assert module that has two
things: (1) the ability to disable assertions with the environment variable
NODE\_NDEBUG, and (2) some API wrappers for argument testing.  Like
`assert.string(myArg, 'myArg')`.  As a simple example, most of my code looks
like this:

```javascript
    var assert = require('assert-plus');

    function fooAccount(options, callback) {
        assert.object(options, 'options');
        assert.number(options.id, 'options.id');
        assert.bool(options.isManager, 'options.isManager');
        assert.string(options.name, 'options.name');
        assert.arrayOfString(options.email, 'options.email');
        assert.func(callback, 'callback');

        // Do stuff
        callback(null, {});
    }
```

# API

All methods that *aren't* part of node's core assert API are simply assumed to
take an argument, and then a string 'name' that's not a message; `AssertionError`
will be thrown if the assertion fails with a message like:

    AssertionError: foo (string) is required
    at test (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:3:9)
    at Object.<anonymous> (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:15:1)
    at Module._compile (module.js:446:26)
    at Object..js (module.js:464:10)
    at Module.load (module.js:353:31)
    at Function._load (module.js:311:12)
    at Array.0 (module.js:484:10)
    at EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:190:38)

from:

```javascript
    function test(foo) {
        assert.string(foo, 'foo');
    }
```

There you go.  You can check that arrays are of a homogeneous type with `Arrayof$Type`:

```javascript
    function test(foo) {
        assert.arrayOfString(foo, 'foo');
    }
```

You can assert IFF an argument is not `undefined` (i.e., an optional arg):

```javascript
    assert.optionalString(foo, 'foo');
```

Lastly, you can opt-out of assertion checking altogether by setting the
environment variable `NODE_NDEBUG=1`.  This is pseudo-useful if you have
lots of assertions, and don't want to pay `typeof ()` taxes to v8 in
production.  Be advised:  The standard functions re-exported from `assert` are
also disabled in assert-plus if NDEBUG is specified.  Using them directly from
the `assert` module avoids this behavior.

The complete list of APIs is:

* assert.array
* assert.bool
* assert.buffer
* assert.func
* assert.number
* assert.finite
* assert.object
* assert.string
* assert.stream
* assert.date

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - boolbase@1.0.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

#boolbase
This very simple module provides two basic functions, one that always returns true (`trueFunc`) and one that always returns false (`falseFunc`).

###WTF?

By having only a single instance of these functions around, it's possible to do some nice optimizations. Eg. [`CSSselect`](https://github.com/fb55/CSSselect) uses these functions to determine whether a selector won't match any elements. If that's the case, the DOM doesn't even have to be touched.

###And why is this a separate module?

I'm trying to modularize `CSSselect` and most modules depend on these functions. IMHO, having a separate module is the easiest solution to this problem.

[download-image]: https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/co-body.svg?style=flat-square
[download-url]: https://npmjs.org/package/co-body

  Parse request bodies with generators inspired by [Raynos/body](https://github.com/Raynos/body).

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install co-body
```

## Options

  - `limit` number or string representing the request size limit (1mb for json and 56kb for form-urlencoded)
  - `strict` when set to `true`, JSON parser will only accept arrays and objects; when `false` will accept anything `JSON.parse` accepts. Defaults to `true`. (also `strict` mode will always return object).
  - `queryString` an object of options when parsing query strings and form data. See [qs](https://github.com/hapijs/qs) for more information.
  - `returnRawBody` when set to `true`, the return value of `co-body` will be an object with two properties: `{ parsed: /* parsed value */, raw: /* raw body */}`.
  - `jsonTypes` is used to determine what media type **co-body** will parse as **json**, this option is passed directly to the [type-is](https://github.com/jshttp/type-is) library.
  - `formTypes` is used to determine what media type **co-body** will parse as **form**, this option is passed directly to the [type-is](https://github.com/jshttp/type-is) library.
  - `textTypes` is used to determine what media type **co-body** will parse as **text**, this option is passed directly to the [type-is](https://github.com/jshttp/type-is) library.

more options available via [raw-body](https://github.com/stream-utils/raw-body#getrawbodystream-options-callback):

## Example

```js
// application/json
var body = yield parse.json(req);

// explicit limit
var body = yield parse.json(req, { limit: '10kb' });

// application/x-www-form-urlencoded
var body = yield parse.form(req);

// text/plain
var body = yield parse.text(req);

// either
var body = yield parse(req);

// custom type
var body = yield parse(req, { textTypes: ['text', 'html'] });
```

## Koa

  This lib also supports `ctx.req` in Koa (or other libraries),
  so that you may simply use `this` instead of `this.req`.

```js
// application/json
var body = yield parse.json(this);

// application/x-www-form-urlencoded
var body = yield parse.form(this);

// text/plain
var body = yield parse.text(this);

// either
var body = yield parse(this);

```js
copy(src).to(des);
copy(src).toCover(des);
copy(src).override(des);

copy(src).pick('proName1', 'proName2').to(des);
copy(src).pick('proName1', 'proName2').toCover(des);
copy(src).pick('proName1', 'proName2').override(des);

copy(src).and(other).to(des);
copy(src).and(other).toCover(des);
copy(src).and(second).and(third).to(des);

copy(src).and(other).pick('proName1', 'proName2').to(des);
copy(src).and(other).pick('proName1', 'proName2').toCover(des);
copy(src).and(second).and(third).pick('proName1', 'proName2').to(des);

var copy = require('copy-to');

var src = {
  _name: 'foo',
  set name(val) {
    this._name = val;
  },
  get name() {
    return this._name;
  },
  show: function () {
    console.log(this._name);
  }
};

var des = {
  _name: 'bar'
};

copy(src).to(des);
copy(src).toCover(des);
copy(src).pick('_name', 'name').to(des);
copy(src).pick('_name', 'name').toCover(des);
```

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

The Academic Free License, v. 2.1:
**********************************

This Academic Free License (the "License") applies to any original work of
authorship (the "Original Work") whose owner (the "Licensor") has placed the
following notice immediately following the copyright notice for the Original
Work:

Licensed under the Academic Free License version 2.1

1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide,
royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license to do the
following:

a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies;

b) to prepare derivative works ("Derivative Works") based upon the Original
Work;

c) to distribute copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the
public;

d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and

e) to display the Original Work publicly.

2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide,
royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license, under patent
claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original
Work as furnished by the Licensor, to make, use, sell and offer for sale the
Original Work and Derivative Works.

3) Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the preferred
form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available
documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor hereby
agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original
Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes.
Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a
machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository
reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as
long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing
the address of that information repository in a notice immediately following
the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.

4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names
of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or
service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this
Original Work without express prior written permission of the Licensor. Nothing
in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights,
patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as
expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or
offer to sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims
defined in Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if
such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be
interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this
License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to
license.

5) This section intentionally omitted.

6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative
Works that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the
Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any
descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must cause
the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent
Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have
modified the Original Work.

7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that
the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein
by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms
of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights
and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately proceeding
sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS
and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation,
the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU.
This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No
license to Original Work is granted hereunder except under this disclaimer.

8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory,
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the
Licensor be liable to any person for any direct, indirect, special, incidental,
or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License
or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss
of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not
apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from Licensor's
negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some
jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original Work or
a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to
obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. Nothing
else but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You)
grants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work
or to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt
to do so except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement
between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the
equivalent laws of other countries, and by international treaty. Therefore, by
exercising any of the rights granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate
Your acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions.

10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically
and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License
as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim,
against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a
patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging
patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or
hardware.

11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this
License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the
Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under
the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The
application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the
scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the
requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. Â§ 101 et
seq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international treaty. This
section shall survive the termination of this License.

12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or
seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including
any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this
License.

13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning
the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to
make it enforceable.

14) Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this License, whether
in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights
under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal
entities, "You" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is
under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, "control" means
(i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such
entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent
(50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such
entity.

15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise
restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not
to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.

This license is Copyright (C) 2003-2004 Lawrence E. Rosen. All rights reserved.
Permission is hereby granted to copy and distribute this license without
modification. This license may not be modified without the express written
permission of its copyright owner.

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - koa-json@2.0.2

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# koa-json

  JSON pretty-printed response middleware.
  Also converts node object streams to binary.

## Installation

```
$ npm install koa-json
```

## Options

 - `pretty` default to pretty response [true]
 - `param` optional query-string param for pretty responses [none]
 - `spaces` JSON spaces [2]

## Example

  Always pretty by default:

```js
var json = require('koa-json');
var Koa = require('koa');
var app = new Koa();

app.use(json());

app.use((ctx) => {
  ctx.body = { foo: 'bar' };
});
```

  yields:

```js
$ GET /

{
  "foo": "bar"
}
```

  Default to being disabled (useful in production), but
  togglable via the query-string parameter:

```js
var Koa = require('koa');
var app = new Koa();

app.use(json({ pretty: false, param: 'pretty' }));

app.use((ctx) => {
  ctx.body = { foo: 'bar' };
});
```

 yields:

```js
$ GET /

{"foo":"bar"}
```

```js
$ GET /?pretty

{
  "foo": "bar"
}
```

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - koa-logger@3.2.1

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# koa-logger

[![npm version][npm-image]][npm-url]
[![build status][travis-image]][travis-url]

 Development style logger middleware for [koa](https://github.com/koajs/koa).  Compatible with [request-received](https://github.com/cabinjs/request-received).

___Notice: `koa-logger@2` supports `koa@2`; if you want to use this module with `koa@1`, please use `koa-logger@1`.___

```
<-- GET /
--> GET / 200 835ms 746b
<-- GET /
--> GET / 200 960ms 1.9kb
<-- GET /users
--> GET /users 200 357ms 922b
<-- GET /users?page=2
--> GET /users?page=2 200 466ms 4.66kb
```

## Installation

```js
$ npm install koa-logger
```

## Example

```js
const logger = require('koa-logger')
const Koa = require('koa')

const app = new Koa()
app.use(logger())
```

## Notes

  Recommended that you `.use()` this middleware near the top
  to "wrap" all subsequent middleware.

## Use Custom Transporter

```js
const logger = require('koa-logger')
const Koa = require('koa')

const app = new Koa()
app.use(logger((str, args) => {
  // redirect koa logger to other output pipe
  // default is process.stdout(by console.log function)
}))
```
or
```js
app.use(logger({
  transporter: (str, args) => {
    // ...
  }
}))
```

  Param `str` is output string with ANSI Color, and you can get pure text with other modules like `strip-ansi`  
  Param `args` is a array by `[format, method, url, status, time, length]`

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.

However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - simple-git@3.13.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# Simple Git

[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/simple-git.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/simple-git)

A lightweight interface for running `git` commands in any [node.js](https://nodejs.org) application.

# Version 3 - Out Now

From v3 of `simple-git` you can now import as an ES module, Common JS module or as TypeScript with bundled type
definitions. Upgrading from v2 will be seamless for any application not relying on APIs that were marked as deprecated
in v2 (deprecation notices were logged to `stdout` as `console.warn` in v2).

# Installation

Use your favourite package manager:

-  [npm](https://npmjs.org): `npm install simple-git`
-  [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/): `yarn add simple-git`

# System Dependencies

Requires [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to be installed and that it can be called using the command `git`.

# Usage

Include into your JavaScript app using common js:

```javascript
// require the library, main export is a function
const simpleGit = require('simple-git');
simpleGit().clean(simpleGit.CleanOptions.FORCE);

// or use named properties
const { simpleGit, CleanOptions } = require('simple-git');
simpleGit().clean(CleanOptions.FORCE);
```

Include into your JavaScript app as an ES Module:

```javascript
import { simpleGit, CleanOptions } from 'simple-git';

simpleGit().clean(CleanOptions.FORCE);
```

Include in a TypeScript app using the bundled type definitions:

```typescript
import { simpleGit, SimpleGit, CleanOptions } from 'simple-git';

const git: SimpleGit = simpleGit().clean(CleanOptions.FORCE);
```

## Configuration

Configure each `simple-git` instance with a properties object passed to the main `simpleGit` function:

```typescript
import { simpleGit, SimpleGit, SimpleGitOptions } from 'simple-git';

const options: Partial<SimpleGitOptions> = {
   baseDir: process.cwd(),
   binary: 'git',
   maxConcurrentProcesses: 6,
   trimmed: false,
};

// when setting all options in a single object
const git: SimpleGit = simpleGit(options);

// or split out the baseDir, supported for backward compatibility
const git: SimpleGit = simpleGit('/some/path', { binary: 'git' });
```

The first argument can be either a string (representing the working directory for `git` commands to run in),
`SimpleGitOptions` object or `undefined`, the second parameter is an optional `SimpleGitOptions` object.

All configuration properties are optional, the default values are shown in the example above.

## Per-command Configuration

To prefix the commands run by `simple-git` with custom configuration not saved in the git config (ie: using the
`-c` command) supply a `config` option to the instance builder:

```typescript
// configure the instance with a custom configuration property
const git: SimpleGit = simpleGit('/some/path', { config: ['http.proxy=someproxy'] });

// any command executed will be prefixed with this config
// runs: git -c http.proxy=someproxy pull
await git.pull();
```

## Configuring Plugins

-  [Completion Detection](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/PLUGIN-COMPLETION-DETECTION.md)
   Customise how `simple-git` detects the end of a `git` process.

-  [Error Detection](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/PLUGIN-ERRORS.md)
   Customise the detection of errors from the underlying `git` process.

-  [Progress Events](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/PLUGIN-PROGRESS-EVENTS.md)
   Receive progress events as `git` works through long-running processes.

-  [Spawned Process Ownership](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/PLUGIN-SPAWN-OPTIONS.md)
   Configure the system `uid` / `gid` to use for spawned `git` processes.

-  [Timeout](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/PLUGIN-TIMEOUT.md)
   Automatically kill the wrapped `git` process after a rolling timeout.

## Using Task Promises

Each task in the API returns the `simpleGit` instance for chaining together multiple tasks, and each
step in the chain is also a `Promise` that can be `await` ed in an `async` function or returned in a
`Promise` chain.

```javascript
const git = simpleGit();

// chain together tasks to await final result
await git.init().addRemote('origin', '...remote.git');

// or await each step individually
await git.init();
await git.addRemote('origin', '...remote.git');
```

### Catching errors in async code

To catch errors in async code, either wrap the whole chain in a try/catch:

```javascript
const git = simpleGit();
try {
   await git.init();
   await git.addRemote(name, repoUrl);
} catch (e) {
   /* handle all errors here */
}
```

or catch individual steps to permit the main chain to carry on executing rather than
jumping to the final `catch` on the first error:

```javascript
const git = simpleGit();
try {
   await git.init().catch(ignoreError);
   await git.addRemote(name, repoUrl);
} catch (e) {
   /* handle all errors here */
}

function ignoreError() {}
```

## Using Task Callbacks

In addition to returning a promise, each method can also be called with a trailing callback argument
to handle the result of the task.

```javascript
const git = simpleGit();
git.init(onInit).addRemote('origin', 'git@github.com:steveukx/git-js.git', onRemoteAdd);

function onInit(err, initResult) {}
function onRemoteAdd(err, addRemoteResult) {}
```

If any of the steps in the chain result in an error, all pending steps will be cancelled, see the
[parallel tasks](<(#concurrent--parallel-requests)>) section for more information on how to run tasks in parallel rather than in series .

## Task Responses

Whether using a trailing callback or a Promise, tasks either return the raw `string` or `Buffer` response from the
`git` binary, or where possible a parsed interpretation of the response.

For type details of the response for each of the tasks, please see the [TypeScript definitions](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/simple-git/typings/simple-git.d.ts).

   `true` the configuration setting is appended to rather than overwritten in the local config. Use the `scope` argument
   to pick where to save the new configuration setting (use the exported `GitConfigScope` enum, or equivalent string
   values - `worktree | local | global | system`).
-  `.getConfig(key)` get the value(s) for a named key as a [ConfigGetResult](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/simple-git/typings/response.d.ts)
-  `.getConfig(key, scope)` get the value(s) for a named key as a [ConfigGetResult](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/simple-git/typings/response.d.ts) but limit the
   scope of the properties searched to a single specified scope (use the exported `GitConfigScope` enum, or equivalent
   string values - `worktree | local | global | system`)

-  `.listConfig()` reads the current configuration and returns a [ConfigListSummary](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/simple-git/src/lib/responses/ConfigList.ts)
-  `.listConfig(scope: GitConfigScope)` as with `listConfig` but returns only those items in a specified scope (note that configuration values are overlaid on top of each other to build the config `git` will actually use - to resolve the configuration you are using use `(await listConfig()).all` without the scope argument)

-  `.cwd({ path, root = false })` Sets the working directory for all future commands either in the current chain of commands (where `root` is omitted or set to `false`) or in the main instance (where `root` is `true`).

## How to Specify Options

Where the task accepts custom options (eg: `pull` or `commit`), these can be supplied as an object, the keys of which
will all be merged as trailing arguments in the command string, or as a simple array of strings.

### Options as an Object

When the value of the property in the options object is a `string`, that name value
pair will be included in the command string as `name=value`. For example:

```javascript
// results in 'git pull origin master --no-rebase'
git().pull('origin', 'master', { '--no-rebase': null });

// results in 'git pull origin master --rebase=true'
git().pull('origin', 'master', { '--rebase': 'true' });
```

### Options as an Array

Options can also be supplied as an array of strings to be merged into the task's commands
in the same way as when an object is used:

```javascript
// results in 'git pull origin master --no-rebase'
git.pull('origin', 'master', ['--no-rebase']);
```

# Release History

Major release 3.x changes the packaging of the library, making it consumable as a CommonJS module, ES module as well as
with TypeScript (see [usage](#usage) above). The library is now published as a single file, so please ensure your
application hasn't been making use of non-documented APIs by importing from a sub-directory path.

See also:

-  [release notes v2](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/RELEASE-NOTES-V2.md)

# Concurrent / Parallel Requests

When the methods of `simple-git` are chained together, they create an execution chain that will run in series, useful
for when the tasks themselves are order-dependent, eg:

```typescript
simpleGit().init().addRemote('origin', 'https://some-repo.git').fetch();
```

Each task requires that the one before it has been run successfully before it is called, any errors in a
step of the chain should prevent later steps from being attempted.

When the methods of `simple-git` are called on the root instance (ie: `git = simpleGit()`) rather than chained
off another task, it starts a new chain and will not be affected failures in tasks already being run. Useful
for when the tasks are independent of each other, eg:

```typescript
const git = simpleGit();
const results = await Promise.all([
   git.raw('rev-parse', '--show-cdup').catch(swallow),
   git.raw('rev-parse', '--show-prefix').catch(swallow),
]);
function swallow(err) {
   return null;
}
```

Each `simple-git` instance limits the number of spawned child processes that can be run simultaneously and
manages the queue of pending tasks for you. Configure this value by passing an options object to the
`simpleGit` function, eg:

```typescript
const git = simpleGit({ maxConcurrentProcesses: 10 });
```

Treating tasks called on the root instance as the start of separate chains is a change to the behaviour of
`simple-git` and was added in version `2.11.0`.

# Complex Requests

When no suitable wrapper exists in the interface for creating a request, run the command directly
using `git.raw([...], handler)`. The array of commands are passed directly to the `git` binary:

```javascript
const path = '/path/to/repo';
const commands = ['config', '--global', 'advice.pushNonFastForward', 'false'];

// using an array of commands and node-style callback
simpleGit(path).raw(commands, (err, result) => {
   // err is null unless this command failed
   // result is the raw output of this command
});

// using a var-args of strings and awaiting rather than using the callback
const result = await simpleGit(path).raw(...commands);

// automatically trim trailing white-space in responses
const result = await simpleGit(path, { trimmed: true }).raw(...commands);
```

# Authentication

The easiest way to supply a username / password to the remote host is to include it in the URL, for example:

```javascript
const USER = 'something';
const PASS = 'somewhere';
const REPO = 'github.com/username/private-repo';

const remote = `https://${USER}:${PASS}@${REPO}`;

simpleGit()
   .clone(remote)
   .then(() => console.log('finished'))
   .catch((err) => console.error('failed: ', err));
```

Be sure to not enable debug logging when using this mechanism for authentication
to ensure passwords aren't logged to stdout.

# Environment Variables

Pass one or more environment variables to the child processes spawned by `simple-git` with the `.env` method which
supports passing either an object of name=value pairs or setting a single variable at a time:

```javascript
const GIT_SSH_COMMAND = 'ssh -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no';

simpleGit()
   .env('GIT_SSH_COMMAND', GIT_SSH_COMMAND)
   .status((err, status) => {
      /*  */
   });

simpleGit()
   .env({ ...process.env, GIT_SSH_COMMAND })
   .status()
   .then((status) => {})
   .catch((err) => {});
```

Note - when passing environment variables into the child process, these will replace the standard `process.env`
variables, the example above creates a new object based on `process.env` but with the `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` property added.

# Exception Handling

When the `git` process exits with a non-zero status (or in some cases like `merge` the git process exits with a
successful zero code but there are conflicts in the merge) the task will reject with a `GitError` when there is no
available parser to handle the error or a
`GitResponseError` for when there is.

See the `err` property of the callback:

```javascript
git.merge((err, mergeSummary) => {
   if (err.git) {
      mergeSummary = err.git; // the failed mergeSummary
   }
});
```

Catch errors with try/catch in async code:

```javascript
try {
   const mergeSummary = await git.merge();
   console.log(`Merged ${mergeSummary.merges.length} files`);
} catch (err) {
   // err.message - the string summary of the error
   // err.stack - some stack trace detail
   // err.git - where a parser was able to run, this is the parsed content

   console.error(`Merge resulted in ${err.git.conflicts.length} conflicts`);
}
```

Catch errors with a `.catch` on the promise:

```javascript
const mergeSummary = await git.merge().catch((err) => {
   if (err.git) {
      return err.git;
   } // the unsuccessful mergeSummary
   throw err; // some other error, so throw
});

if (mergeSummary.failed) {
   console.error(`Merge resulted in ${mergeSummary.conflicts.length} conflicts`);
}
```

With typed errors available in TypeScript

```typescript
import { simpleGit, MergeSummary, GitResponseError } from 'simple-git';
try {
   const mergeSummary = await simpleGit().merge();
   console.log(`Merged ${mergeSummary.merges.length} files`);
} catch (err) {
   // err.message - the string summary of the error
   // err.stack - some stack trace detail
   // err.git - where a parser was able to run, this is the parsed content
   const mergeSummary: MergeSummary = (err as GitResponseError<MergeSummary>).git;
   const conflicts = mergeSummary?.conflicts || [];

   console.error(`Merge resulted in ${conflicts.length} conflicts`);
}
```

### Enable Verbose Logging

See the [debug logging guide](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/DEBUG-LOGGING-GUIDE.md#verbose-logging-options) for
the full list of verbose logging options to use with the
[debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) library.

### Every command returns ENOENT error message

There are a few potential reasons:

-  `git` isn't available as a binary for the user running the main `node` process, custom paths to the binary can be used
   with the `.customBinary(...)` api option.

-  the working directory passed in to the main `simple-git` function isn't accessible, check it is read/write accessible
   by the user running the `node` process. This library uses
   [@kwsites/file-exists](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kwsites/file-exists) to validate the working directory exists,
   to output its logs add `@kwsites/file-exists` to your `DEBUG` environment variable. eg:

   `DEBUG=@kwsites/file-exists,simple-git node ./your-app.js`

### Log format fails

The properties of `git log` are fetched using the `--pretty=format` argument which supports different tokens depending
on the version of `git` - for example the `%D` token used to show the refs was added in git `2.2.3`, for any version
before that please ensure you are supplying your own format object with properties supported by the version of git you
are using.

For more details of the supported tokens, please see the
[official `git log` documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log#_pretty_formats)

### Log response properties are out of order

The properties of `git.log` are fetched using the character sequence `ò` as a delimiter. If your commit messages
use this sequence, supply a custom `splitter` in the options, for example: `git.log({ splitter: '💻' })`

### Pull / Diff / Merge summary responses don't recognise any files

-  Enable verbose logs with the environment variable `DEBUG=simple-git:task:*,simple-git:output:*`
-  Check the output (for example: `simple-git:output:diff:1 [stdOut] 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)`)
-  Check the `stdOut` output is the same as you would expect to see when running the command directly in terminal
-  Check the language used in the response is english locale

In some cases `git` will show progress messages or additional detail on error states in the output for
`stdErr` that will help debug your issue, these messages are also included in the verbose log.

### Legacy Node Versions

From `v3.x`, `simple-git` will drop support for `node.js` version 10 or below, to use in a lower version of node will
result in errors such as:

-  `Object.fromEntries is not a function`
-  `Object.entries is not a function`
-  `message.flatMap is not a function`

To resolve these issues, either upgrade to a newer version of node.js or ensure you are using the necessary polyfills
from `core-js` - see [Legacy Node Versions](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/LEGACY_NODE_VERSIONS.md).

# Examples

### using a pathspec to limit the scope of the task

If the `simple-git` api doesn't explicitly limit the scope of the task being run (ie: `git.add()` requires the files to
be added, but `git.status()` will run against the entire repo), add a `pathspec` to the command using trailing options:

```typescript
const git = simpleGit();
const wholeRepoStatus = await git.status();
const subDirStatusUsingOptArray = await git.status(['--', 'sub-dir']);
const subDirStatusUsingOptObject = await git.status({ '--': null, 'sub-dir': null });
```

### async await

```javascript
async function status(workingDir) {
   let statusSummary = null;
   try {
      statusSummary = await simpleGit(workingDir).status();
   } catch (e) {
      // handle the error
   }

   return statusSummary;
}

// using the async function
status(__dirname + '/some-repo').then((status) => console.log(status));
```

### Initialise a git repo if necessary

```javascript
const git = simpleGit(__dirname);

git.checkIsRepo()
   .then((isRepo) => !isRepo && initialiseRepo(git))
   .then(() => git.fetch());

function initialiseRepo(git) {
   return git.init().then(() => git.addRemote('origin', 'https://some.git.repo'));
}
```

### Update repo and get a list of tags

```javascript
simpleGit(__dirname + '/some-repo')
   .pull()
   .tags((err, tags) => console.log('Latest available tag: %s', tags.latest));

// update repo and when there are changes, restart the app
simpleGit().pull((err, update) => {
   if (update && update.summary.changes) {
      require('child_process').exec('npm restart');
   }
});
```

### Starting a new repo

```javascript
simpleGit()
   .init()
   .add('./*')
   .commit('first commit!')
   .addRemote('origin', 'https://github.com/user/repo.git')
   .push('origin', 'master');
```

### push with `-u`

```javascript
simpleGit()
   .add('./*')
   .commit('first commit!')
   .addRemote('origin', 'some-repo-url')
   .push(['-u', 'origin', 'master'], () => console.log('done'));
```

### Piping to the console for long-running tasks

See [progress events](https://github.com/steveukx/git-js/blob/main/docs/PLUGIN-PROGRESS-EVENTS.md) for more details on
logging progress updates.

```javascript
const git = simpleGit({
   progress({ method, stage, progress }) {
      console.log(`git.${method} ${stage} stage ${progress}% complete`);
   },
});
git.checkout('https://github.com/user/repo.git');
```

### Update repo and print messages when there are changes, restart the app

```javascript
// when using a chain
simpleGit()
   .exec(() => console.log('Starting pull...'))
   .pull((err, update) => {
      if (update && update.summary.changes) {
         require('child_process').exec('npm restart');
      }
   })
   .exec(() => console.log('pull done.'));

// when using async and optional chaining
const git = simpleGit();
console.log('Starting pull...');
if ((await git.pull())?.summary.changes) {
   require('child_process').exec('npm restart');
}
console.log('pull done.');
```

### Get a full commits list, and then only between 0.11.0 and 0.12.0 tags

```javascript
console.log(await simpleGit().log());
console.log(await simpleGit().log('0.11.0', '0.12.0'));
```

### Set the local configuration for author, then author for an individual commit

```javascript
simpleGit()
   .addConfig('user.name', 'Some One')
   .addConfig('user.email', 'some@one.com')
   .commit('committed as "Some One"', 'file-one')
   .commit('committed as "Another Person"', 'file-two', {
      '--author': '"Another Person <another@person.com>"',
   });
```

### Get remote repositories

```javascript
simpleGit().listRemote(['--get-url'], (err, data) => {
   if (!err) {
      console.log('Remote url for repository at ' + __dirname + ':');
      console.log(data);
   }
});
```
